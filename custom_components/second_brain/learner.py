"""The self-improver's learning pass: failures.md -> self_improving.md.

The per-turn analyzer writes what went wrong or could be shorter; this reads
that backlog and turns a *repeated* pattern into a rule the assistant follows
on every turn. It is the second half of the self-improvement feature, kept
apart from the librarian: the librarian curates knowledge (wiki, rules.md
hygiene), this one changes behaviour.

Guardrails, in order of how much they matter:
  - only a pattern seen twice or more earns a rule,
  - nothing listed in not_a_defect.md may ever become one (the human's veto),
  - at most MAX_ADDS rules a run, at most MAX_REMOVES retractions,
  - rules land in self_improving.md, never in the human-owned rules.md.

that were answered correctly but took more tool calls than they needed
(`analyzer:detour`). Nobody reads this file during a conversation - it exists so
you can turn a repeated problem into a rule the assistant *does* read.

Only act on a pattern, never on a one-off. Two or more entries of the same shape,
with a fix you can state in one sentence, earn a rule. Every rule must carry an
`evidence` list: two or more snippets copied VERBATIM from two DIFFERENT entries
below. A rule whose evidence does not match the text below is dropped, so do not
paraphrase, and do not pad the list with entries of another shape to reach two -
a one-off simply does not earn a rule yet.

- `get_statistics entity_id='sensor.solar_production_today' -> No long-term
  statistics` three times, and the store knows the real meter is
  `sensor.pv_total` -> rule: "for solar production use sensor.pv_total, the
  template sensor has no statistics".
- two `analyzer:detour` entries about the same question shape -> rule naming the
  short path: "to answer current solar production, call GetLiveContext for
  'Test Solar Power' only".

A rule that saves a round trip is worth as much as one that prevents a wrong
answer: it makes the assistant faster, and a faster assistant is a better one.

Do not write a rule that restates a tool description, one you cannot support
with entries below, or one that is really a fact (facts belong in the wiki).

**Retract auto-rules that went wrong.** self_improving.md is yours to prune: if a
current rule is contradicted by the backlog or by the accepted list, emit a
`rules_to_remove` item with a `containing` snippet identifying that one bullet.
Never touch rules.md - it is human-owned.

**Acknowledge what you handled.** For every entry you turned into a rule, emit a
`failures_acknowledged` item with a `containing` snippet and a short `note`. The
entry is marked, never deleted - it stays as the debugging record, it just drops
out of the next run's backlog. Never acknowledge an entry you did nothing about.

Return JSON only, no markdown fences:

  "rules_to_add": [
    {"text": "for solar production use sensor.pv_total, the template sensor has no statistics",
     "evidence": ["entity_id='sensor.solar_production_today'", "No long-term statistics"]}
