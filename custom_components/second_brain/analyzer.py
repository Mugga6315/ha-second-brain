"""Per-turn self-improvement analyzer.

Runs in the background after each assist turn that used this integration. It
reviews the turn (thinking effort configurable) and, when it finds a misfire,
appends one line to failures.md - the same input the nightly learner turns into
a rule. It never blocks the assist path and never writes a rule itself; that
judgement (does a repeated pattern deserve a rule) stays with the learner.

Signal it looks for, all decidable from the turn alone:
  - redundant/unused tool calls (efficiency),
  - denied-but-present: an answer says a device is missing while it is exposed,
  - over-broad action: a whole area toggled when one device was named AND the
    area holds more than one matching device,
  - rule adherence: a violation of an active rule,
  - language: an answer in a different language than the question,
  - detour: the answer was right but took more calls than the task needs, and
    the shorter path can be named. This is what makes the assistant faster over
    time, not only more correct.

1. Redundant/unused tool calls (efficiency): the SAME call repeated, or a call whose result clearly did not contribute to the answer. A single reasonable preparatory call is NOT redundant (e.g. GetDateTime to resolve "today" before a date-scoped read).
2. Structural misfire, checkable against the exposed entities in the assistant's context:
   - denied-but-present: the answer says a device/sensor is missing, yet it is exposed (and no read tool was called to check).
   - over-broad action: an action targeted a whole area/domain AND that area/domain holds MORE THAN ONE matching device, so it hit devices beyond the one named. If exactly one matches, targeting the area is fine - do NOT flag it.
3. Rule adherence: did the turn violate an active rule shown in the assistant's context (e.g. answered in the wrong language)?
4. Detour on a CORRECT turn (the answer was right, the path was not): the same result was reachable with fewer calls or in one step - searching or listing to find an entity the context already exposed, reading state before an action that does not need it, or probing to work out how a tool behaves. Say which single call (with its arguments) would have been enough. Only flag a detour you can name that shorter path for.
   A RECOVERY call is never a detour: when a call failed or came back empty and the next call tries another way to get the same thing (a search after a note was not found, a broader read after a narrow one missed), that call is the assistant doing its job. It is not waste just because it happened to find nothing this time - on another turn it is what saves the answer. Judge only the calls the turn could have skipped knowing what it knew BEFORE it made them.

5. Language: the answer must be in the language the question was asked in - a German question gets a German answer. Flag only a different language, never wording or tone.

Return ONLY JSON:
{"verdict": "clean" | "misfire" | "improvable",
 "categories": ["redundant" | "denied_but_present" | "over_action" | "rule_violation" | "detour" | "wrong_language" ...],
 "evidence": "one sentence citing the specific calls/answer",
 "failure_entry": "<one concise line for failures.md that the nightly learner could turn into a rule>" | null}
"improvable" is for point 4: right answer, wasteful path. The entry then states the shortcut, e.g. "answering 'how warm is X' took search_brain then GetLiveContext; GetLiveContext alone answers it".
